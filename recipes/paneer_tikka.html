            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tsp amchur powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp chaat masala</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground black pepper, powder (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp ajwain seeds</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of oil</li>
            <li>½ tbsp of ghee, or butter</li>
            <li>½ lime</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin the dish, line a wire strainer with muslin cloth and pour in the yoghurt. Tie the ends of the muslin together and hang over a bowl for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dice the paneer into 2cm chunks, sprinkle with salt and chilli powder and set aside. Soak the bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the hung curd to a large bowl and mix until smooth. Add all of the spice powders, the ginger-garlic paste and oil to the bowl and whisk thoroughly to incorporate all of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the paneer to the marinade, mix gently to coat and marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill to the highest possible temperature, or use a tandoor if you have one.</li>
            <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper and spray or brush with melted ghee or butter. Thread the paneer onto skewers and place on the baking tray. Grill for 2 minutes, then carefully turn the skewers and grill for a further 2 minutes, until lightly browned along the edges.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skewers to a serving plate, drizzle with the lime juice and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
